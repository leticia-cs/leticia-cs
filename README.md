**Nice to meet you!**

I am a design student with a passion for interfaces and finding ways to help people. I like to make a change!

**What am I working on?**

  - This semester, my classes are focused on web and app development, but also on audio and video production. We have a bunch of projects currently on development.
  - I recently started working as a freelancer on my free-time. So much knowledge, but still a lot to learn! I'm enjoying it
  - Working on side projects to learn Python
  - Investing five days a week on learning the web combo: HTML, CSS and JavaScript
  - Trying not to overcook my Strawberry Jam 🙃
