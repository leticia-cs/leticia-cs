<b>Nice to meet you!</b>

I am a design student with a passion for general knowledge, interfaces, and finding ways to help people. I like to make a change!

<b>What am I working on?</b>

  - This semester, my classes are focused on web and app development, but also on audio and video production. We have a lot of projects currently on development that I can't wait once it's time to share!
  - I recently started working as a freelancer on my free-time. So much knowledge, but still a lot to know! I'm enjoying it.
  - Working on side projects to learn Python
  - Investing five days a week on learning the web combo: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
  - Trying not to overcook my Strawberry Jam üôÉ
